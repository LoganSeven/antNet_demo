AntNet demo with ACO Network Adaptation â€“ Implementation Roadmap

Core Constraints to Integrate
-----------------------------

Node latency must be part of path cost.  
  Incorporate each node's delay into the evaluation function. Heuristic desirability should reflect both edge weight and destination latency.

Min/Max hop constraints must be enforced.  
  Ensure all paths comply with bounds on node count. Penalize under-length or over-length paths. Invalidate or heavily penalize invalid tours.

Evaluation function must combine distance and latency.  
  Transition desirability should decrease with both edge cost and downstream delay. Maintain flexibility to swap in different heuristics.

Performance and Architecture Requirements
-----------------------------------------

C implementation required for core algorithm.  
  Avoid pure Python for performance. Use compiled code for path construction, evaluation, and pheromone update.

Thread-safe updates to pheromone matrix.    
   Batched updates after each iteration

Full SIMD compatibility for critical loops.  
  Vectorize transition probability evaluation and cost calculations where applicable. Use aligned data and avoid pointer aliasing.

Multithreaded agent execution.  
  Each ant or agent must build its path in parallel. Synchronize only during critical write phases (e.g., pheromone updates).

GUI Integration Checklist (PyQt5)
---------------------------------

Asynchronous architecture.  
  Ensure UI thread remains responsive.
  Use QThread, QRunnable, or QtConcurrent.

Use Qt signals/slots for communication with queued connections.  
  Notify GUI of progress or solution updates without direct access to backend data structures. 

Front/backend decoupling.  
  Ensure algorithm can run headless (CLI mode) or plugged into different UIs (modularity target).

Test and Validation Goals
-------------------------

Stress test with large graphs.  
  Validate correctness and performance on graphs with high node counts and variable latencies.

Thread profiling required.  
  Check for race conditions, deadlocks, and mutex contention. Confirm linear or sub-linear speedup with thread count.

Path quality under constraints.  
  Evaluate solution validity and quality when hop constraints and latency vary.

Measure gains from SIMD.  
  Profile vectorized operations separately from threading to assess local speedups.

Extensibility & Maintenance
---------------------------

Modular cost function system.  
  Plug-in architecture or function pointers to allow multiple path evaluation strategies.

Configuration file or CLI parameter system.  
  Avoid hardcoded limits. Define all core parameters (ant count, iterations, latency weight, etc.) externally.

Optional multi-colony model.  
  Multiple independent ACO runs with separate pheromone matrices can increase scalability.
